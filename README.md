#  Hospital Readmission Predictor

This project uses a logistic regression machine learning model to predict patient readmission risk based on electronic health record (EHR) data.

##  Features
- Logistic Regression model with feature scaling
- Class balancing using `class_weight='balanced'`
- Performance metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC
- Patient-level prediction function

## ðŸ“Š Technologies
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter

##  Files
- `readmission_model.ipynb`: Main notebook (data loading, preprocessing, model training & evaluation)

##  Use Case
This model could be used by hospitals to identify high-risk patients before discharge and reduce avoidable readmissions.
